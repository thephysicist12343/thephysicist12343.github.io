# Analysing Sunspots Patterns using Fourier Transforms
On this page, I am going to explain a project I worked on, where I analysed sunspot patterns using Fourier Transforms. I shall first go over Fourier Analysis and Fourier Transforms, focusing majorly on Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), which I used in the project. Then, I shall introduce sunspots and what prompted this research. Finally, I shall explain the project and discuss its relevance. I would like to acknowledge Professor Prantika Bhowmik from the Indian Institute of Science who helped guide me in this project. A list of references is included for each section.
