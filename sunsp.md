# Analysing Sunspots Patterns using Fourier Transforms
On this page, I am going to explain a project I worked on, where I analysed sunspot patterns using Fourier Transforms. I shall first go over Fourier Analysis and Fourier Transforms, focusing majorly on Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), which I used in the project. Then, I shall introduce sunspots and what prompted this research. Finally, I shall explain the project and discuss its relevance. I would like to acknowledge Professor Prantika Bhowmik from the Indian Institute of Science who helped guide me in this project. A list of references is included for each section. 

## Fourier Analysis

### Introduction: The Premise and the Fourier Series
If you are interested in mathematics, physics, or engineering, you have probably heard of a Fourier Analysis. But what exactly is it, how does it work mathematically, and why is it used so much in physics and engineering? The basic premise of the Fourier Analysis is the fact that most patterns can be represented by adding together sinusoidal (sine or cosine functions) of different periods.
