# Multivariable Calculus
## Introduction
In July of 2025, I decided to start learning multivariable calculus from MIT OpenCourseWare. The course is called 18.02, and taught by Professor Denis Aurouox (you can find it [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)). On this page, I'll upload some things I found fascinating in the course, and some 3D models which I've created in relation to this.
