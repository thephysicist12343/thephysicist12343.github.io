# Introduction
Hello, my name is Aarav Rastogi! I'm a high school student interested in physics and mathematics, and I also enjoy studying literature, philosophy, and history. In my free time, I enjoy playing the classical guitar or listening to classical music. On this website, I'll write about various projects that I have undertaken or am undertaking right now.
